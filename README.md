Interactive Particle System in JavaScript
=========================================

Description
-----------

Welcome to my Interactive Particle System project, a vivid and engaging demonstration of JavaScript's powerful capabilities in creating dynamic, interactive web experiences. This project utilizes the HTML5 Canvas API to create a mesmerizing particle system where particles on the canvas react to user mouse movements, creating an ever-changing tapestry of motion and interaction.

### Key Features:

- Dynamic Particle Creation: Hundreds of particles are generated, each with unique properties, showcasing the randomness and fluidity of natural motion.
- Mouse Interaction: Particles are attracted to the mouse cursor as it moves across the canvas, creating a visually appealing effect that feels both reactive and organic.
- Responsive Design: Fully adaptable to various window sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across different devices.
- Optimized Performance: Carefully tuned to balance visual quality and computational efficiency, making it smooth across a wide range of devices.

### Technologies Used:

- JavaScript: The heart of the project, used for creating particle behavior and interactive elements.
- HTML5 Canvas API: For rendering dynamic graphics and animation.

### How It Works:

The canvas populates with particles that move in random directions. When the user hovers the mouse over the canvas, these particles are gently pulled towards the cursor, creating a stunning visual effect. This interaction is a blend of simple physics concepts (like velocity and distance calculations) and creative programming.

### Project Status:

This project is a living example of my journey in exploring the creative possibilities of web development. It's regularly updated with improvements in both performance and visual appeal.

### Getting Started:

To explore this project, simply clone the repository, run the docker build command, and once that's complete run docker.

**Commands**

1. Docker Build: `docker build -t particle-system .`
2. Docker Run: `docker run -p 8080:80 particle-system`
